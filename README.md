### Project Description:
This project implements a micro-version of Instagram using custom data structures such as linked lists, graphs, stacks, queues, and binary search trees. The project aims to simulate the core features of Instagram, including user profiles, friend requests, posts, messages, notifications, real-time messaging, and search functionalities.

### Technologies Used:
1. **C++ Programming Language** 💻
   - The entire project is implemented in C++ using standard libraries and custom data structures.
   
2. **Linked Lists** 🔗
   - Used for implementing user profiles, posts, messages, and notifications.
   
3. **Graph Data Structure** 🌐
   - Used to represent user relationships (friend connections).
   
4. **Stacks** 📚
   - Used for managing posts and messages with the most recent at the top.
   
5. **Queues** ⏳
   - Used for managing friend requests, notifications, and real-time messaging.
   
6. **Hash Lookup** 🔑
   - Used for username and password verification during login.

7. **Binary Search Trees (BST)** 🌳
   - Used for efficient searching of users by their usernames in a sorted order.

### Key Features:
- **User Profile**: Includes attributes like name, password, city, posts, and last login.
- **Messages**: Stack-based management of conversations between users.
- **Friend Requests**: Managed using a queue, with FIFO processing.
- **Notifications**: A queue stores notifications such as friend requests and messages.
- **Real-time Messaging**: Simulates message sending and receiving in real-time using queues.
- **Search Users**: A BST is used to allow searching for users by their usernames.
- **Scalability**: Modular design to support future feature expansions.

### Error Handling:
The project implements clear error messages to help users understand issues such as duplicate friend requests, invalid usernames, and login errors.

This project is built to simulate core functionalities of Instagram using C++ and custom data structures. The project will provide valuable learning in data structures and algorithm implementation.
